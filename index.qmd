There are many good point guards in the NBA, such Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving, Ja Morant, and Jalen Brunson. I got my data from the [NBALoveR package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NBAloveR/index.html) and [Statmuse](statmuse.com). The data was then used to plot the graphs about the players and their stats. This data project seeks to explain which NBA point guard is the best.
