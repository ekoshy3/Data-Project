## About This Project

This projects explores which NBA point guard that scores above 25 points is the best. 
This project was made for [David Kane's Free Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info).

In this project, I collected data about all the point guards who scored 25 or more points per game on average, and graphed the data to find out who is best.
